Non-relational database for JSON docs
  key:value
Schemaless "dynamic schema" database
Drawbacks:

  - no transactions
  
Mongo shell is a stand alone interface for the MongoDB

Spark framework <= more research needed

Arrays and dictonanes are the two ?? 

use 'db-name'

Manipulating data: 
  db-name.collection.command({})
  
Commands: 
  Entering = save
  Search = find
  Entering = insert
  Find one = findOne
  
Finding one document
  db-name.collection.findOne({})({field:boolean})
    - second object is boolean for returning that field

The .pretty may be appended onto the end of the command to format result
